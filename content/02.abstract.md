## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The PyData ecosystem is an umbrella term covering Python packages based on a
broad range of modern techniques, such as chunk-compressed columnar data
storage, just-in-time compilation of numerical code, and scaling of
calculations across clusters of computers. Together, these technologies have
been successful applied in scientific applications using data at the petabyte
scale. These technologies, and the many benefits that they provide, however,
have not been successfully applied in the field of genomics, which is currently
making the transition to working at petabyte scale. We present sgkit, a Python
package designed to bring the benefits of the PyData ecosystem to genomics,
allowing users to efficiently analyse large-scale data using familiar tools. We
discuss the underlying design principles of these technologies and illustrate
their suitability in genetics and genomics applications, via examples on
large-scale datasets such as UK Biobank.
